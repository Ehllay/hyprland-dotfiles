[::] Bibata Cursor
TLDR; This cursor set is a masterpiece of cursors available on the internet,
hand-designed by Abdulkaiz Khatri(https://twitter.com/ful1e5).

Bibata is an open source, compact, and material designed cursor set that aims
to improve the cursor experience for users. It is one of the most popular cursor sets
in the Linux community and is now available for free on Windows as well, with multiple color
and size options. Its goal is to offer personalized cursors to users.

[::] What does "Bibata" mean?
The sweetest word I ever spoke was "BI-Buh," which, coincidentally, is also the word for peanuts.
To make it more pronounceable and not sound like a baby's words, I added the suffix "Ta."
And with that, my journey in the world of open source began.
